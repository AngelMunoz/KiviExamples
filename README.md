# Hello everyone!
This repo contains some examples of the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) GUI Framework for python so, don't expect something fancy here, just some python demos. 
by the way, you can open this repo directly in visual studio 2015 :) just don't forget to add your virtual environments and install all the dependencies.
These run on python 2.7 because of the framework.
if for some reason you can't run your app because a DLL import error please try to install dependencies with this command

`python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew kivy.deps.gstreamer --extra-index-url https://kivy.org/downloads/packages/simple/`

:) have a nice day
